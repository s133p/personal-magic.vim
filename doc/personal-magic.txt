INTRODUCTION                                    *personal-magic*

This plugin is a collection of useful functions, mappings, and sugar that
powers my daily use.

MAPPINGS                                        *personal-magic-mappings*

Delete surroundings is *ds* .  The next character given determines the target
to delete.  The exact nature of the target is explained in |surround-targets|
but essentially it is the last character of a |text-object|.  This mapping
deletes the difference between the "i"nner object and "a"n object.  This is
easiest to understand with some examples:

  Old text                  Command     New text ~
  "Hello *world!"           ds"         Hello world!
  (123+4*56)/2              ds)         123+456/2
  <div>Yo!*</div>           dst         Yo!

Change surroundings is *cs* .  It takes two arguments, a target like with
|ds|, and a replacement.  *cS* changes surroundings, placing the surrounded
text on its own line(s) like |yS|.  Details about the second argument can be
found below in |surround-replacements|.  Once again, examples are in order.

  Old text                  Command     New text ~
  "Hello *world!"           cs"'        'Hello world!'
  "Hello *world!"           cs"<q>      <q>Hello world!</q>
  (123+4*56)/2              cs)]        [123+456]/2
  (123+4*56)/2              cs)[        [ 123+456 ]/2
  <div>Yo!*</div>           cst<p>      <p>Yo!</p>

*ys* takes a valid Vim motion or text object as the first object, and wraps
it using the second argument as with |cs|.  (It's a stretch, but a good
mnemonic for "ys" is "you surround".)

  Old text                  Command     New text ~
  Hello w*orld!             ysiw)       Hello (world)!
